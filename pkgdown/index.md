`bigsimr` is an R package for simulating high-dimensional multivariate data with arbitrary marginal distributions

bigsimr lets you simulate multivariate data given a correlation matrix and a list of distributions. The correlation matrix can be of type Pearson, Spearman, or Kendall.

You can install the release version of the package from GitHub:

```r
devtools::install_github("SchisslerGroup/bigsimr")
```

To get a bug fix or to use a new feature, you can install the development version from GitHub:

```r
devtools::install_github("SchisslerGroup/bigsimr", ref="develop")
```

This package depends on
[reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) to draw on the speed
of Googleâ€™s [jax](https://github.com/google/jax) library. Please see the [bigsimr installation instructions](https://schisslergroup.github.io/bigsimr/articles/install-bigsimr.html) for more details.

If on Windows or a system without Python, then the package will default to alternative methods. The option can be toggled with

```r
options(use_jax = FALSE)
```

Currently Google's jax library does not have ready-to-use binaries for Windows. The recommendation is to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), otherwise you will need to build `jaxlib` from source ([see here](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer.html#additional-notes-for-building-jaxlib-from-source-on-windows)).

Additionally, Windows does not allow for forked multiprocessing, so there will be no performance enhancement on a multicore Windows machine.

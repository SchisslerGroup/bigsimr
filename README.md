## Installation

You can install the released version of bigsimr from
[github](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SchisslerGroup/bigsimr")
```

This package relies on
[reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) to draw on the speed
of Google’s [jax](https://github.com/google/jax) library. The easiest
way to get a working python environment is to use miniconda and create a
new environment. We provide a handy function for making the conda
environment.

``` r
library(bigsimr)
install_bigsimr(method = "conda", envname = "bigsimr")
```

### Development version

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you
can install the development version of bigsimr from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SchisslerGroup/bigsimr", ref="develop")
```

### GPU version

Since jax has the ability to compile code to the CPU and GPU, bigsimr
also has the ability to benefit from GPU acceleration. Follow the [jax
installation guide](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) for
getting a GPU version.

## Overview

  - `rvec()` simulates multivariate data with specified marginal
    distributions and correlation
  - `cor_rand_PD()` generate a random postitive definite correlation
    matrix
  - `cor_rand_PSD()` generate a random postitive semidefinite
    correlation matrix
  - `cor_convert()` convert *from* one correlation *to* another
  - `cor_bounds()` compute the theoretical lower and upper correlations
    for a target multivariate distribution

## Usage

Reticulate needs to be able to find the python binary with `jax`
installed. It is recommended to use Miniconda.

``` r
# reticulate::use_condaenv("bigsimr-cpu")
library(bigsimr)
```

to generate multivariate data, we need a list of marginals (and their
parameters), and a correlation structure (matrix). The marginal
distributions can be built up using R’s special `alist` function. This
means that you can enter the distributions without evaluation.

``` r
margins = alist(
  qnorm(mean = 3.14, sd = 0.1),
  qbeta(shape1 = 1, shape2 = 4),
  qnbinom(size = 10, prob = 0.75)
)
```

The next step is to define a correlation structure for the multivariate
distribution. This correlation matrix can either come from observed
data, or we can set it ourselves, or we can generate a random
correlation matrix via `bigsimr::cor_rand_PSD()`.

``` r
rho <- cor_rand_PSD(d = 3)
```

Finally we can generate a random vector with our specified marginals and
correlation structure. The last argument, `type`, is looking to know
what kind of correlation matrix it is receiving. Right now it can handle
the Pearson product-moment correlation, Spearman’s \(\rho\), or
Kendall’s \(\tau\).

``` r
x <- rvec(100, rho, margins, type = "pearson")
```

``` r
# Sample correlation
cor(x)
#>            [,1]       [,2]       [,3]
#> [1,]  1.0000000 -0.3594361 -0.1796841
#> [2,] -0.3594361  1.0000000  0.3796276
#> [3,] -0.1796841  0.3796276  1.0000000
```

``` r
# Estimated upper and lower correlation bounds
cor_bounds(margins, type = "pearson")
#> $upper
#>           [,1]      [,2]      [,3]
#> [1,] 1.0000000 0.9537691 0.9708819
#> [2,] 0.9537691 1.0000000 0.9831462
#> [3,] 0.9708819 0.9831462 1.0000000
#> 
#> $lower
#>            [,1]       [,2]       [,3]
#> [1,]  1.0000000 -0.9525312 -0.9700770
#> [2,] -0.9525312  1.0000000 -0.8680406
#> [3,] -0.9700770 -0.8680406  1.0000000
```

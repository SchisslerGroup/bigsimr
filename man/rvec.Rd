\arguments{
\item{n}{The number random vectors to generate.}

\item{rho}{The input correlation matrix.}

\item{margins}{The marginal distributions (Typically R's "quantile functions")}

\item{cores}{The number of cores to utilize.}

\item{type}{The type of correlation matrix that is being passed (Assumed to
be Pearson by default).}
}
\value{
A matrix of random vectors generated from the specified marginals
  and parameters.

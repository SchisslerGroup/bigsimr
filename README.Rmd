Simulate arbitrary multivariate distributions efficiently in R.

## Installation

You can install the released version of bigsimr from [github](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("adknudson/bigsimr")
```

This package relies on [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) to draw on the speed of Google's [jax](https://github.com/google/jax) library. The easiest way to get a working python environment is to use miniconda and create a new environment. We provide a handy function for making the conda environment.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(bigsimr)
install_bigsimr(method = "conda", envname = "bigsimr")
```

### Development version

To get a bug fix or to use a feature from the development version, you can install 
the development version of bigsimr from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("adknudson/bigsimr", ref="develop")
```

### GPU version

Since jax has the ability to compile code to the CPU and GPU, bigsimr also has the ability to benefit from GPU acceleration. Follow the [jax installation guide](https://github.com/google/jax#installation) for getting a GPU version.

## Overview

* `rvec()` simulates multivariate data with specified marginal distributions and correlation
* `rcor()` generate a random correlation matrix
* `convertCor()` convert _from_ one correlation _to_ another
* `computeCorBounds()` compute the theoretical lower and upper correlations for a target multivariate distribution

## Usage

```{r}
library(bigsimr)
# Reticulate needs to be able to find the python binary with `jax` installed
reticulate::use_condaenv("bigsimr")
```

To generate multivariate data, we need a list of marginals (and their parameters), and a correlation structure (matrix). The marginal distributions can be built up as a list of lists, where each sublist contains the information for the target distribution. 

Note that in each sublist, the first item is an unnamed character string with the R name of the distribution _without a letter prefix_. E.g. instead of `rnorm`, we pass in just `"norm"`. The second thing to note is that the remaining items are _named_ arguments that go along with the distribution. A full list of built-in distributions is found in the appendix.

```{r}
margins = list(
  list("norm", mean = 3.14, sd = 0.1),
  list("beta", shape1 = 1, shape2 = 4),
  list("nbinom", size = 10, prob = 0.75)
)
```

The next step is to define a correlation structure for the multivariate distribution. This correlation matrix can either come from observed data, or we can set it ourselves, or we can generate a random correlation matrix via `bigsimr::rcor()`.

```{r}
# rho <- rcor(d = 3)

rho <- matrix(0.5, nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
diag(rho) <- 1.0
rho
```

Finally we can generate a random vector with our specified marginals and correlation structure. The last argument, `type`, is looking to know what kind of correlation matrix it is receiving. Right now it can handle the Pearson product-moment correlation, Spearman's $\rho$, or Kendall's $\tau$.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
x <- rvec(100, rho = rho, params = margins, type = "pearson")
```

```{r}
# Sample correlation
cor(x)
```

```{r}
# Estimated upper and lower correlation bounds
computeCorBounds(margins)
```
